Notes:

1) Relationship between file names and labels in Figure 2 of Problem Set 3 
File Names           Figure 2 Labels
“GoodPPG”            	yo
“CorruptedPPG”       	y
“noise_reference”    	a  

2) There is one “GoodPPG” reference signal that can be used to compare your      
“recovered” signals, z, with for both data sets. 

3) One of the data sets is “tricky.” Can you explain why you are getting strange results? 

4) How do you think you should choose the filter order?
